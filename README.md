## This github
This github contains a txt file, Shellscript file and a txt file of https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen. (Last updated on 15/03/2022)  


## Text file 
The data we had to use was the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen Wikipedia.  
You can put this into a txt file by selecting it all and
pasting it in the txt file (can be done with ctrl + A)
I uploaded the Wikipedia RUG txt file as well but you could also grab your own txt file.  


## The program
The program can be run on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS

Downloading and using the script can be done by using the following commands:  

```
git clone https://github.com/thijmenadam0/ITRM.git  
cd ITRM  
bash find_de.sh wiki.txt
```  

The output of this file gives 252 times 'de' (case-insensitive).
