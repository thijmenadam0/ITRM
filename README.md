# Introduction to Research Methods

Sharing the code for the fifth milestone for Introduction to Research Methods.  
For this milestone I used a PDF file.  
The data I used is available, you could also grab your own Wikipedia PDF.  

## Steps on how to download the PDF file. (Or just download the one I uploaded to GitHub)

First you go to the wikipedia page you want to download.  
Then you press "Download as PDF".  
If you can't find this option check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Download_as_PDF.  

## BEFORE YOU RUN THE FILE USE 'sudo apt install pdftohtml'
This is so you can use the command 'less' to open the PDF.
