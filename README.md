# Introduction to Research Methods

Sharing the code for the fifth milestone for Introduction to Research Methods.  
For this milestone I used a PDF file.  
The data I used is available, you could also grab your own Wikipedia PDF.  

## Steps on how to download the PDF file. (You could also download the one I uploaded to GitHub)

First you go to the wikipedia page you want to download.  
Then you press "Download as PDF".  
If you can't find this option check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Download_as_PDF.  

## Before you run the file use the command 'sudo apt install pdftohtml' in your bash.
This is so you can use the command 'less' to open the PDF and read the file.

The output of this file gives 253 times 'de'.
